1. A simple and famous "Tic Tac Toe" game.

2. "Sea Battle" game.
You can play it through the terminal.
Note: if the code stopped with the error ValueError("Unable to find valid coordinates for the ship. Reduce ship density or increase board size."), then the program is having problems placing ships on the playing field, so simply restart the program again (usually after cupple of restarts, the program finds how to correctly place the ships) or run with an increased board size (BOARD_SIZE in the Board class) or a reduced number of ships (ship_lengths in def Place_ships in the Board class).
